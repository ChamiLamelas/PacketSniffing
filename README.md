# Packet Sniffing

Repository where I experiment with `psutil` and `scapy` for bandwidth measurements in the interest of looking into network plans. `psutil` is used for system wide
network usage measurements. `scapy` is used to perform packet sniffing to get per process bandwidth measurements.

Setup: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Running: `python <filename> -h` for all `src/` files besides `misc.py`.

You will see a `results` folder being created by `monitor` files.
